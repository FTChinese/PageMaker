departments and organisations are hungry for innovation. But they are often uncertain where to start and it can be tempting to avoid the risk associated with change by finding all the reasons why it cannot happen.<\/p><p>But Oliver Burrows, chief data officer at the Bank of England, is not one of those <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/reports\/business-turnrounds\">executives<\/a>. He knew, as many leaders do, that the workload of his department would increase, but resources would not.<\/p><p>As the post-2008 financial crisis regulatory environment demanded more data collection, greater detail and more analysis, his <ft-content type=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/ontology\/content\/Article\" url=\"http:\/\/api.ft.com\/content\/80d3cdc0-6ff4-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5\">team<\/ft-content> of 150 risked being swamped. Just making people work harder was not a sustainable strategy so he needed to develop ways to cope with the increased demand.<\/p><p>Like many large, traditional organisations, his department was hierarchical and complex. The easy assumption would have been that significant change would be difficult, political and perhaps more trouble than it was worth. But Mr Burrows was determined to try.<\/p><p>\u201cWhen I dug into the governance, I discovered that, at my level, we have quite a lot of freedom to decide how to achieve our objectives,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it can be a social norm not to use it.\u201d<\/p><p>What Mr Burrows did not do was to map out a new department structure or summon his <ft-content type=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/ontology\/content\/Article\" url=\"http:\/\/api.ft.com\/content\/69859b98-98e0-11e9-8cfb-30c211dcd229\">leadership<\/ft-content> team to a lavish off-site. Instead, he was excited by the idea of loosening the <ft-content type=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/ontology\/content\/Article\" url=\"http:\/\/api.ft.com\/content\/24f2ee84-59dc-11e8-b8b2-d6ceb45fa9d0\">hierarchical culture<\/ft-content> of his department and developing small experiments that the whole team could try in order to create smarter ways of working.<\/p><p>Mr Burrows put a call out to his team. This was an experiment in itself \u2014 and one that revealed far more appetite for innovation than he had expected. People were excited by inventing change, rather than having it thrust upon them.<\/p><p>Together, the volunteers mapped out 12 experiments, some of which worked and some of which, Mr Burrows shrugs, did not. \u201cI made the decision to open up our senior management meetings to anyone who wanted to sit in,\u201d he says. \u201cAt first, lots turned up but over time they drifted off. Turns out, it wasn\u2019t all that exciting.\u201d<\/p><p>Other experiments were more successful. \u201cWe also made the annual appraisal process a lot more participatory,\u201d says Mr Burrows, \u201cthat worked really well.\u201d Then there were \u201csome technical coding projects\u201d that Mr Burrows says no one in the management team would have thought of, or been brave enough to try. \u201cThey just tried them and they worked,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of that. Everyone was.\u201d<\/p><p>But the \u201cbig win\u201d was sourcing strategy ideas from the bottom up. \u201cIn the past, people thought strategy was the preserve of management types \u2014 which meant not them. But there were just so many good ideas out there.\u201d<\/p><p>Without a massive, expensive, bold departmental redesign, Mr Burrows had liberated significant creativity among his team. He had found new ideas and new sources for ideas, producing change while conducting business as usual. <\/p><p>Yet when I suggested a similar process to an executive vice-president at a FTSE 100 company, he looked at me aghast. Experiments? Asking people for help? In his eyes, that would be an expression of weakness, admitting that he did not have all the answers. But of course, he did not have all the answers and the hierarchy in his head stopped him from reaching into his organisation to find them. <\/p><p>For years, management theorists and consultants have created such <em>sturm und drang<\/em> around change that some managers have become averse to the risk it involves.<\/p><p>But \u201cexperiments\u201d sound less risky.

This is a question G7 finance ministers and central bankers might have asked as they met in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.economie.gouv.fr\/G7-finance-en\">Chantilly<\/a> in France this week.<\/p><p>At the start of the previous decade, global trade was growing at almost 8 per cent a year, twice the pace of growth in gross domestic product. This year, however, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wto.org\/english\/news_e\/pres19_e\/pr837_e.htm\">World Trade Organization<\/a> expects trade to rise by a mere 2.6 per cent \u2014 the same as projected global GDP growth.<\/p><p>Unsurprisingly, this turnround has sparked hand-wringing about the cost of the current trade wars. Indeed, G7 ministers have pointed to this as evidence that protectionism could spark a wider global economic downturn.<\/p><p>But amid this entirely understandable concern, there is one crucial detail that is overlooked: the slowdown in trade started well before the recent eruption of protectionism. That suggests we cannot blame our current woes on the trade wars alone \u2014 although protectionism is, of course, worth fighting against.<\/p><p>The issue at stake was set out on Tuesday by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bis.org\/speeches\/sp190514.pdf\">Hyun Song Shin<\/a>, chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, at a meeting of senior finance officials organised by the Banque de France in Paris. <\/p><p>Mr Shin started by noting that there are several ways to track trade. The metric commonly used is absolute real or nominal trade. There is, however, another: the ratio of gross exports to net GDP. And the latter metric is particularly revealing right now, since it indicates the activity of cross-border global supply chains, or \u201cglobal value chains\u201d, as economists prefer to say. Complex GVCs generate multiple export \u201csales\u201d \u2014 and the more extensive these chains are, the higher is that gross export number relative to GDP.<\/p><p>This gross exports series shows that between 2000 and 2008 there was a frenzy of activity in global supply chains. Indeed, as Mr Shin explained, gross exports relative to GDP exploded by a cumulative 16 per cent, due to intense supply chain activity between China and the west. <\/p><p>However, when the 2008 financial crisis hit, gross exports crumbled. No surprise there, perhaps. But what is more remarkable is that, while gross exports recovered in 2009, they have never returned to anything like the pre-2007 figure. More striking still, since 2011 gross exports have steadily declined relative to GDP \u2014 meaning, Mr Shin noted, that \u201cthe slowdown in trade predates the retreat into protectionism and trade conflicts in the last couple of years\u201d.<\/p><p>Why? One explanation might be that services are becoming more important in the global economy than manufacturing. Another might be technological innovation: automation has cut the cost of western manufacturing, <ft-content type=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/ontology\/content\/Article\" url=\"http:\/\/api.ft.com\/content\/3ea3de18-9993-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36\">reducing the need<\/ft-content> to outsource production to low-wage locations such as China.<\/p><p>However, Mr Shin thinks another crucial \u2014 and overlooked \u2014 factor is finance. Companies need hefty amounts of working capital to run their supply chains, and about two-thirds of this typically comes from their own resources, with the other third coming from bank and non-bank finance.<\/p><p>During the pre-2007 credit boom it was easy for companies to find working capital and trade finance. But, since then, the crisis banks have reined this in. This is partly because post-crisis regulations have made it more costly for western banks to supply such funding, but also because banks\u2019 resources have been hit by the debilitating impact of ultra-low interest rates and the flattening yield curve.<\/p><p>Currency swings also hurt. About 80 per cent of trade finance is supplied in dollars, and trade invoicing tends to be dollar-based, too. This means that dollar strength tends to affect the ability of companies in emerging markets to finance supply chains.<\/p><p>Now, it is highly unlikely that this subtle message about the role of finance will gain much attention from politicians, let alone voters. However, if Mr Shin\u2019s analysis is correct (as I think it is), it has at least three important implications. <\/p><p>First, it underscores the importance of studying financial channels in tandem with \u201creal\u201d economic trends if you want to understand the global economy. Second, the research suggests that the pre-2007 credit bubble not only created a house price boom, but also helped create a trade and GVC bubble, too.<\/p><p>Third, insofar as this bubble has now burst, it seems unrealistic to expect that the world will recreate that global trade surge anytime soon \u2014 even if, by some miracle, <ft-content type=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/ontology\/content\/Article\" url=\"http:\/\/api.ft.com\/content\/870c895c-7b11-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560\">the US and China<\/ft-content> suddenly end the trade war.
